Website Highlight Saver Chrome Extension
Task
Build a Chrome extension that allows users to highlight text on any webpage and save highlights locally.

Features
User selects text on any page.

Show a small popup (“Save Highlight?”) near selection.

Clicking the extension icon (in Chrome toolbar) opens a popup that shows a scrollable list of all saved highlights.

Allow deleting highlights.

Optional: Get a quick AI summary inside the popup via a "Summarize" button. Connect to OpenAI API for this.

You do NOT need to submit the extension to the chrome web store. Record one video showing the demo of what you’ve built by loading the extension locally on your browser. Use Loom or any other tool to record yourself and your computer screen. Minimum duration should be 2 minutes, maximum 5 minutes and the ideal length would be around 3-4 minutes. IMPORTANT NOTE: You have to show your face as well. Make sure to speak in English while showing the demo.
